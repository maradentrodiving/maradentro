    <h1>Advanced Open Water Diver</h1>
    <p>
      Five different scenarios, five dives in which you’ll face something new. Go a little deeper, dive at night, glide on a current … No doubt, a course attractive like few others.
    </p>

    <p>
      Best of all, you learn while you dive. Practice prevails on theory.
    </p>

    <p>
      You’ll make 5 training dives that will push you a little further,
      as you try out new diving conditions (a night dive, for example)
      or do tasks different to the usual (the rescue of an object). At the end of
      the course you’ll feel a more experienced diver. It will boost your confidence.
